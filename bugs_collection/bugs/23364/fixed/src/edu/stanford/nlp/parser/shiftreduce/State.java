/**
 * A class which encodes the current state of the parsing.  This can
 * be used either for direct search or for beam search.
 * <br>
 * Important information which needs to be encoded:
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>A stack.  This needs to be updatable in O(1) time to keep the
 * parser's run time linear.  This is done by using a linked-list type
 * stack in which new states are created by the <code>push</code>
 * operation. 
 *
 * <li>A queue.  This also needs to be updatable in O(1) time.  This
 * is accomplished by having all the states share the same list of
 * queued items, with different states only changing an index into the
 * queue.
 *
 * <li>The score of the current state.  This is useful in beam searches.
 *
 * <li>Whether or not the current state is "finalized".  If so, the
 * only thing that can be done from now on is to idle.
 *
 * </ul>
